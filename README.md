# Point of Sale (POS) System

## Project Overview

This is a web-based Point of Sale (POS) system built with React, designed for managing products and transactions in a retail environment. The system allows users to view products, add them to the shopping cart, manage the cart, and proceed to checkout. It also includes features like product filtering, cart item management, and a dashboard for better user experience.

## Features

- **Product Management**: Displays a list of products fetched from an API with information like name, price, stock, and category.
- **Shopping Cart**: Allows users to add and remove products, as well as update quantities in the cart.
- **Checkout**: Enables users to review the cart and simulate a checkout process.
- **Responsive Design**: The interface adjusts to different screen sizes to ensure usability on both desktops and mobile devices.
- **Dashboard Navigation**: Includes a button that allows users to return to the dashboard from the POS screen.

## Tech Stack

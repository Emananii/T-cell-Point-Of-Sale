## üìã Project Overview

This project is a web-based Point of Sale (POS) system built using **React** for the frontend. It enables users in a retail environment to manage product listings, process customer purchases, and record completed sales.

The system provides essential POS functionalities like browsing products, managing a shopping cart, performing a checkout that updates backend sales records, and navigating through a user-friendly dashboard. It‚Äôs built to be responsive, clean, and easy to extend in future versions (e.g., adding authentication, live stock management, etc.).
